# auto_grader
Read python files with specific functions and apply unittest and return the total grade

Different codes/sampels should be placed in A1/ folder with name of <name>_<anything>.py

files:
1- q3.py: The skeleton file with 10 blank spaces to be completed for grading.
2- q3_sol.py: Solution of the Q3
1- A1/q3_sample.py: Suggested solution to be graded for Q3

The result would be a CSV file, with the name, grade (out of 10) and the failed cases.

warning: the code will take care of error in running different functions, but will terminate with uneven indentation.
