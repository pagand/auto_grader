# auto_grader
Read python files with specific functions and apply unittest and return the total grade
Suggested solution for Q3 is q3_sol.py
different codes/sampels should be placed in A1/ folder with name of <name>_<anything>.py
the result would be a CSV file, with the name, grade (out of 10) and the failed cases.

warning: the code will take care of error in running different functions, but will terminate with uneven indentation.
